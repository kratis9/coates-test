# Coates Technical Assessment

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

I have implemented the assignment based on the given requirement with best practices by following code modularity and abstraction principle in mind. I have spent 4 hours based on the time availability.


Created a Redux store to save the history of sent mails. I have configured the redux tool to give you a better understanding of the state. There is some room for improvement and refactoring, but I haven't implemented detailed normalization and other store management best practices because of time availability.



:bulb: Please let me know once the review is completed so that I can remove the code from GIT

## Time taken :watch:

4 HOURS; Although it was challenging to take time out of your normal weekend activities, I worked on the implementation part on my weekends. I did some refactoring on Monday morning; 

Based on the occupancy, I haven't write tests to my code that I want to do and I hate code with test. I had plans to add cypress test's of the UI part and supertest for API testing but due to the time constraint and optional requirement, I have parked it.

### TODOs

- [ ] Add API tests
- [ ] Add Unit tests(UI)
- [ ] Add Cypress tests(UI)
- [ ] Code Deployment CI/CD - https://coates-mailer-app.netlify.app/
